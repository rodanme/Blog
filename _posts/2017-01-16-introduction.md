The fact that it has taken me this long to set up this page is a testament to my inability to follow directions, at least the ones pertaining to technology. The site's appearance may change occasionally while I fiddle around and try to work out some kinks. 

### What is this?

This is the first of hopefully many posts for my blog. My experience with "blogging" is severely limited to my 8th grade Xanga, which I am very embarrassed to admit had much more activity than my current social media platforms. Like any other blog out there I'll be using this to chronicle my thoughts and experiences while I'm here in the Philippines: the places I eat (All of them), practicing the language (trying to haggle unsuccessfully), and how I get around (Slowly, because traffic is crazy). I'll also be writing about my experiences with the Philippine health care system and how it is currently tackling the topic of mental health. Updates will occur on at least weekly basis, most likely on Thursday or Friday night Manila time. 

### Where am I? 

I am staying with family in Metro Manila, more specifically Cainta, for those familiar with the area. In the very near future I will be living on my own in the Ortigas area. 

### Why am I here?

Finished up my Master's program at Boston University applied to medical school and did not get in. Because I was gifted with the invaluable opportunity of time, I wanted to do something for myself. Graduate school was great and I learned quite a bit. I came out of it feeling confident in my ability to excel academically and endure the daily grind, which was a relief because I floundered during the first few years of college. It also helped me strengthen my resolve to pursue my personal interest in teaching and mental health. I have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember. It has controlled my decisions, caused countless missed opportunities, and has pushed me to the lowest points of my life. Thankfully I have been inordinately blessed with loving, understanding, and supportive family and friends. I really do count myself as fortunate because not every individual is met with open arms, especially in the Asian American community where the topic of mental health is not always adequately addressed or conceptualized. Which leads me to the next question. 

### What am I doing? 

The main reason for my stay here in the Philippines is to explore mental health. The stigma in the Philippines is occurring on a different level compared to the United States. When I was initially looking for opportunities I was surprised at the number of mental health related NGOs and hospital programs available. To say that mental health is being completely ignored here would be incorrect. The problem is that no one has any idea what resources are available. For now I have taken on a position at the National Center for Mental Health and another as the mental health liaison for Facebook page Payong Medikal. My goal here is help with the education and advocacy of mental health, particularly for adolescents. 

### 3 Things:

I'll wrap things up with a New Year's Resolution. I have been writing down 3 things that I'm thankful for/made me happy every day. The top picks of the week will be at the end of the posts. To preserve an individual's anonymity if a person makes the list their initials will be used. There will probably be repeats because I'm always happy to video chat with my parents or drink a good cup of coffee. In no particular order: 

1. Arguing about ugly dogs (pugs are gross)
2. First blog post is up
3. Remembering base rate fallacy

### P.S.

The E-mail icon on the home page is for questions related to the blog or my activities. If you want me to answer something personally, or if you want a topic addressed on the blog give it a clickâ€¦ it will open a new tab that has my blog E-mail address in the URL...the button will someday directly open your E-mail client.
