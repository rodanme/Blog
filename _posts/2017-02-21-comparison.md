Comparison is the thief of joy. 

It isn’t fair to compare apples to oranges. 

It isn’t fair to compare the United States to the Philippines. 
But it happens anyway. 

I have an irresistible tendency to measure things based on my previous experiences. It makes me comfortable. Allows me to set expectations and prepare myself accordingly. Enables my arrogance and condescension. 

It is so easy to get caught up in an unfair comparison. The effort it takes my fingers to scroll through the recent WHO Philippine mental health profile is equivalent to the amount of effort it takes to make that biased judgement. While walking over potholes through the sprawling hectares of the facilities, it was second nature to feel superior. Squatter homes and ramshackle huts stood next to dilapidated patient wards on both sides of the road. Seeing rusting iron bars over windows made it easy for my outrage and disappointment to bubble up. It looked more like a jail than a center for mental health. Assaulted by the smell of urine, stepping over fresh cement patched holes in the floor, skirting a bowl catching water dripping from ceiling it was easy to be condescending. It was a minefield of health violations. Absolutely no way this could happen in the United States. 

As I sat in the air conditioned office of the doctor, who oversees the female chronic patient wards, it was hard to ignore the muffled sounds of wailing women while he explained patient flow through the facilities. Passing by cells filled with women in pink shifts squatting on white tiled floors it was hard not to notice the single naked body with a gash on her face and white cloth strips tethering her limbs to a metal cot. Walking through the “garden” it was hard not to imagine a flock of pink geese as women shuffled two by two and sat on the patches of grass to be sunned. 

I was incredibly uncomfortable. I am incredibly uncomfortable, still. There is no previous experience with which I can make a comparison. The hospital is incredibly understaffed and lacking funds. There is a single doctor managing the care of nearly 600 patients in his wards. When I asked about community outreach he laughed regretfully. It consists of a single doctor and her nurses that lecture with a megaphone at the people in line for free screenings – a captivated captive audience still within the gates of the facilities. 
Medicines are purchased from generic manufacturers with the lowest bids. When the supplies run low, available medications are funneled to meet the needs in the acute and outpatient wards. Until more is available, the chronic patients, some of which have been under the hospital’s care for a decade, will have to make do with whatever is left. Patients with infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV are quarantined. Combative patients are placed in isolation cells for a time out. It is pragmatic. It is triage. 

The situation is confusing and upsetting. The government supports each patient staying in the hospital therefore it makes sense to prioritize medications to patients with a higher likelihood of leaving hospital care. Less people staying in the hospital means less burden on the overworked and understaffed facility. This also means less medication for the hundreds of chronic patients dependent on the hospital. Combative patients that endanger the wellbeing of their fellows should be carefully monitored, so they are placed in personal iron-barred rooms in view of the nursing station.  It also makes sense quarantine those with infectious diseases together to prevent spread to the healthy population. If the only available space is a larger cell, the other patients are in them, so be it. 

Although the facility is the poster child for a place that would scare the living daylights out of anyone suffering from a mental illness, it is a necessity. It is far from perfect but it provides free screenings and care to as many as it can. The doctors, nurses, nurse aides, and staff work with what they are given to make ends meet. It is so easy to saunter in, wreathed in morality, and immediately cast blame. The government is corrupt so the money doesn’t go where it needs to. Patients are left to their own devices because the nurses on duty don’t care. Chronic patients get less care because they have a lower chance of leaving the hospital.
A common hypothetical question in medical school interviews: save a dying girl with a single vaccine or manufacture copies for the population? Easy answer. The good of the many over the good of the few. I can look down on the situation as much as I want; I can believe that I am a better person. But morality is not currency. There are still a handful of medical professionals for scores of patients in need of care. I struggle with the notion that given the exact same situation, I would run the hospital in the exact same way. The situation is confusing and upsetting.
