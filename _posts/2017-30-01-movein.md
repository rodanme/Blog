Yesterday was move in day!

I’m living on my own again feeling equally thrilled and terrified. The condo is much more space than a single person needs which is great. I will have to resist the urge to buy things to fill the empty shelves. I’m incredibly grateful that my uncle and aunt are letting me stay here because I would not be able to afford the rent otherwise. The location is conveniently sandwiched between two malls, one of which just opened next door. Everything I need from groceries to a movie theatre should be in walking distance. The mall here is life. They are their own little ecosystems but that post is for another day.

It was nice not having to worry about anything. When I woke up in the morning breakfast was made and coffee was ready. I put my laundry in the hallway and it was washed once or twice a week. Even my room got cleaned once a week while I was out at church. The katulong, Lanie and Liselle, will be missed. It’s fairly common for families here to have helpers, live with them. Labor is cheap so there may be a person in charge of cooking and groceries, another for cleaning and laundry, and perhaps a third as a driver. 

All that being said, it’s exciting to finally be able to say that I’m living on my own in a different country, albeit the facts that I have family living in three surrounding cities and that I have basic mastery of the language. I value self-sufficiency. I missed cooking my own food, running my own errands, and even doing my own laundry. Only washing the clothes though. I doubt I will ever overcome my intense dislike of warm laundry waiting to be folded. I figure that by accomplishing these basic tasks I will be on my way to successfully “adulting” in the Philippines. 

3 Things:

1. Darkest Dungeon
2. Snapchats of people watching anime
3. Reconnecting with a not so old friend
