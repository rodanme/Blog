The end of last week was hectic so this post did not make the weekly deadline. In any case, let’s start with Friday. I attended an event at Warehouse Eight a co-working and event space owned and managed by a friend of mine. The event was part of a series called The Makers which features local passion projects from different industries and the people behind them. The topic for this event was geared towards something Filipinos and most human beings can relate to – food. The guest speakers were all members of the food and beverage industry ranging from chefs and restaurant owners to magazine editors and coffee roasters.

My favorite guest speakers were Mylene Chung and Kyle Francia. Mylene is a food photographer and the creator of food blog Pepper.ph. She also mentioned that she is an anime fan and cosplay enthusiast but of course that did not contribute at all to my favoritism. During her talk she walked us through her journey into the food industry. She started out photographing people, but felt uncomfortable directing her subjects. Through a serendipitous message on the internet she wound up taking photos for a small bakery’s menu and discovered her love for photographing food. I enjoyed learning about what goes on behind the scenes of delicious pictures of food. Sometimes the food isn’t even food. Apparently, the foam head on top of a picture of beer is often soap suds. Taking pictures of food is an art and Mylene has encouraged me to be more conscious about my Instagram pictures of food.

Kyle Francia is the mind behind Tusk Social, a local brand focused on creating an approachable cocktail experience.. I had the chance to talk to Kyle during the break and try one of his signature Negroni cocktails. Made with gin, vermouth, and Campari this cocktail is right up my alley since I’m not a fan of sweet things. The Negroni mixes the great flavors of gin and vermouth with a hint of fruit from the Campari. As a bartender Kyle wanted to make the cocktails more accessible for young people who are used to drinking beer. Tusk Social packages their cocktails premixed in serving sized bottles that can easily be taken home and enjoyed. I did buy one of packaged cocktails, but sadly, it never made it home. Oops.

The casual atmosphere and the easy going, friendly nature of the speakers made the experience seem more like a chat between friends than a conference.  Although I don’t have any particular interest in owning or operating a food related venture, it was amazing to see a room full of passionate people engage with leaders in the field. It motivates me to continue pursuing what I am doing here.  I hope that in the near future I will be able to put an event together and gather people in discussion of mental health.

I have been working on getting more involved with patient education and advocacy and I think I have found the place to do it. The Philippine Alliance of Patient Organizations (PAPO) had a board meeting last Saturday to begin planning their strategies for the year and I was invited to sit in and document the meeting. Each of the members were heads of their advocacy groups such as diabetes, hepatitis C, and cerebral palsy. Over the years, I have participated in various organizations in different capacities and gone through countless planning meetings but never anything on this scale. I did not expect the meeting to go on for five and half hours but it was time well spent. The majority of the meeting centered on how to manage PAPO’s current stakeholders, and how to convince institutional bodies and members to co-create strategies with PAPO and develop ownership in the organization. It was a lot of new vocabulary. I’m a geek when it comes to learning though and the concepts are applicable to what I want to accomplish here.

The best part of the meeting for me was lunch, it was free and I talked with Jess Lorenzo who facilitated the meeting. Jess works with local governments to create long term public work strategies. One of the things that he is currently working on is a plan for community based drug rehabilitation.  Given that the available rehabilitation facilities are overwhelmed in light of current events, a community based plan is incredibly important. It was comforting to see someone working with local governments to provide an alternative resource. Jess was kind enough to refer me to his expert, Dr. Soriano, and I am excited to pick his brains about possibilities for community based education programs.
