  When I initially planned my move to the Philippines I didn’t take into account how being so far away from home would affect my support systems. After high school, each move has taken me farther away from Grand Rapids. First, college in Ann Arbor was a two hour drive; followed by graduate school in Boston, a three hour plane ride; and now I’m a hemisphere away living in Manila. The concept of moving so far away was always more exciting than scary. 

  The greatest struggle of being so far away from my close friends and family is getting in touch with my support system. I’m not one to get homesick but it was incredibly comforting to have my mom and sister visit for a week. I do my best to stay in touch with my family by doing things like video chatting while they have dinner and I drink my morning coffee. However, that can’t be replaced by actually sitting down and talking about our days. Being able to give my mom a hug or poke my sister in the face while she watched YouTube was rejuvenating.

  My network here in the Philippines has made me feel more than welcome but I haven’t reached that critical mass of comfortability. I like to walk everywhere. I used to use this time to call my parents, sisters, or my friends. My mom is my go to person to talk to after my exams and the ‘favorite contacts’ feature in my phonebook is full of people I like to catch up with while I’m commuting. The biggest limiting factor in my communication with people from home is the 12 hour time difference. When I’m ready to digest daily events most people are on their way to class or work. But, I am thankful for the internet which makes getting a hold of people across the world more convenient. I can reach out and talk to someone with one of four messaging apps on my phone: Telegram, Viber, WeChat, and FB Messenger – people really need to agree on one messaging medium. 

  This past weekend I was reminded of another avenue of support. I had the opportunity to join a team from California as they met with local human trafficking organizations in Cebu. Their plan is to expand their U.S. based foundation, Hope Mountain, to the Philippines and provide long term aftercare to siblings who are victims of cyber sexual exploitation. Each of our meetings took place with like-minded faith based groups caring for individuals who had suffered from sexual abuse. It was truly amazing to see people being cared for physically, mentally, and spiritually. Seeing the girls at the shelter laughing and singing with the team members moved me. It was hard to believe these girls could be so joyful despite what they had experienced. It really is a testament to the good works that can come out of faith and belief. 

  My faith is an often neglected portion of my support system. After all, you can still have a chat with God even if you don’t have any WiFi or load. My connection to church and organized religion the past few years can be described as tenuous at best. I continue to firmly believe in God and I take time to talk with him daily but for a number of reasons, which I may discuss in the future, I have not felt called to actively participate in church. The past few days, however, have been a sorely needed reminder of the impact a healthy belief can have on a person’s life. A personal inventory and reexamination on my beliefs is undeniably necessary.
